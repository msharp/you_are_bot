# You Are Bot

Trolling Twitter morons with condescending observations about their poor grammar.

Finds a message which uses _your_ when it should be _you're_ and sends them a message.

If the trolled user responds, it retweets their response.

Invoked with crontab (don't run too frequently, or will get banned)
